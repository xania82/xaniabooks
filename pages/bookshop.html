<p>He was supposed to be dead. Dead and buried. Or was he? (<em>The Selenics</em> Book 1)</p>
<p>A mystery romance with a vampire twist &#8211; or is it? The White Worm could be behind it all, but Claire doesn’t think so. Her husband died of an accident on his farm estate, simple as that. But why do mysterious events keep happening after his death &#8211; even at the funeral? Who are those strange women, a ‘sisterhood’ hanging around the village accompanied by a group of teenage girls dressed in bright red dresses? It’s a micro mini gothic romance series with a hint of something wicked in the air.</p>

<h4><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2OIcNaC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Night Bus</a>, and other stories, by Alister Morton</strong></h4>
<p>Three short stories to grab your imagination at Halloween or in the dead of night and twist your mind to contemplate the unknown. Fear of what might have been, or what might be to come. You will never ride a bus again without thinking of the darkness that may await you at the terminus. These quick reads will linger long in your imagination.</p>
<p>This scary collection starts with <em>Halloween Fun</em>, carries you along to <em>Party Time</em>, and finally, very finally, leads you on to <em>The Night Bus</em>.</p>
<p>Set in and around a fictional Oxford which you won&#8217;t want to visit, you will never look at the dreaming spires in the same way again. Oxford&#8217;s buses are woven into the stories, leading you to a deadly Halloween party &#8211; or is it? Was this the party that they had been invited to &#8211; or a different one? And who, exactly, had invited them?</p>
<p>An unworldly seance in Wytham woods &#8211; or is that really what it is? What happened to the last passenger who vanished, and what happened on the bus when it mysteriously ground to a halt on the night before Halloween? And remember, Senorita Muerta, don&#8217;t drink the wine.</p>
<p>Three micro-reads, short stories to stir your imagination at a lunch break, while travelling to and from work or even, if you dare, on <strong>the Night Bus</strong>.</p>

<h4><a href="https://amzn.to/2OGVdnn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Easy Fitness for Over 40s</strong></a></h4>
<p><em><strong>How to get fit and stay fit in just 20 minutes a day</strong></em></p>
<p>I called this course &#8216;Easy&#8217; because that&#8217;s exactly what it is. The exercises should take less than 20 minutes to complete, and although you will certainly feel that you have made an effort, you should never have to find yourself pushing through any &#8216;pain barrier&#8217;.</p>
<p>I first started doing the exercise routines described in this book when in my mid-forties. I quickly became as fit as I can remember feeling since my youth. Then, inexplicably, I became over-confident in my new-found fitness and let it lapse &#8211; for much too long. Fast-forward to my mid-fifties and I had become an overweight, grossly unfit couch potato. Luckily, I was able to muster up the motivation to revisit these exercise routines from my past and have since become as fit as I can remember being since my mid-forties. However, it took much more effort. Don&#8217;t let this happen to you.</p>
<p>You are now in your forties, the prime of life. Start now, keep at it, and you will never regret it. Your future health, and life expectancy, is in your hands. I can guarantee that, if you follow the steps set out in this book, you will feel a real difference in just a few weeks.</p>
<p>Are you ready to commit to your future and follow your fitness plan for life?</p>

You may not lose pounds, but you will gain muscle, and shape, and health, through a painless process, one that you can maintain as the years go by, keeping up an age-defying youthful aura as you head towards your sixties, seventies, and beyond.</p>
